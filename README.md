Mehboob Hussain – Portfolio Website

Welcome to my personal portfolio! This website was built to showcase my journey as a Fullstack Developer — highlighting my projects, technical skills, and creative approach to solving problems through code.

The goal of this portfolio is to provide a glimpse into my work, my background, and my ability to design and build modern, responsive web applications. You’ll find sections about me, my featured projects, and a way to get in touch for collaboration or opportunities.
